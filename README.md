# Practical Approaches to Research and Discovery Using African Genomic Diversity

### 1–2 February 2025, The 15th African Society for Human Genetics Conference. Entebbe, Uganda

[Course Time Table 2025](coming soon..) <br /> 

### Summary

The genomic diversity of Africa is regarded as an invaluable resource for advancing the understanding of disease mechanisms, identifying novel genetic variants, and uncovering complex disease architectures. However, the full potential of this diversity has not been fully utilised, partly due to gaps in capacity and limited access to genomic research tools.

To address these challenges, the workshop “Practical Approaches to Research and Discovery Using African Genomic Diversity” is being hosted in collaboration with the African Society of Human Genetics (AfSHG). This event aims to empower researchers with the knowledge and practical skills needed to leverage African genomic diversity for impactful discoveries in health and disease.

This course aligns with global efforts to increase representation and equity in genomic research, facilitating access to datasets such as H3Africa, and providing a platform for capacity building, collaboration, and knowledge transfer by experts in the field.

**What will this course cover?**

This hands-on workshop will include:

- Developing research questions for genomic discovery focused on diseases prevalent in African populations.
- Utilising African genomic diversity to identify novel/rare variants and study complex genetic architectures using tools such as GWAS and WGS.
- Practical training in methodologies, including family studies, systematic data mining, and research toolkit creation tailored to diverse settings.
- Interactive sessions to bridge the gap between bioinformatics analysis and actionable insights.
- Participants will also engage in mentoring and networking opportunities with leading experts, fostering long-term collaborations across the continent.
