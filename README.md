[Course Time Table 2025](coming soon..) <br /> 

### Summary

African genomic diversity represents an invaluable resource for advancing the understanding of biological mechanisms, uncovering novel genetic variants, and elucidating complex disease architectures. However, its full potential remains underutilised due to limited access to skills and tools for translating genomic approaches and data into research and practice.

The workshop **“Practical Approaches to Research and Discovery Using African Genomic Diversity”** —hosted in collaboration with the [15th African Society of Human Genetics Conference and the 1st Ugandan Society of Human Genetics and Bioinformatics](https://afshg2025.org/) —aims to bridge this gap. It will equip scientists with the knowledge and practical skills to leverage African genomic diversity for impactful impactful discoveries in health and disease.

**What will this workshop cover?**

Aligned with global efforts to enhance representation and equity in genomic research, this workshop will showcase effective approaches and guide participants in identifying, accessing, and analysing genomic data. This hands-on workshop will focus on developing research questions for genomic discovery, leveraging African genomic diversity to study genetic variants and architectures, and applying systematic data mining techniques. Through expert-led and interactive sessions, mentoring, and networking opportunities, the workshop will foster collaboration, knowledge exchange, and professional growth, enabling participants to derive actionable insights and make meaningful use of African genomic diversity.

**Target audience:** Early career researchers, healthcare or other professionals interested in applying genomics to conduct their research

### Prerequisites

To ensure participants can fully benefit from the workshop, the following prerequisites are recommended:

- A foundational understanding of genomics, including genetic variants, sequencing, and basic data analysis.
- Basic experience with genomic workflows, such as sequence alignment, variant calling, data preprocessing, and quality control.
- Familiarity with genomic databases and computational tools for genomic analysis is helpful but not mandatory.
- A background in research, healthcare, biology, bioinformatics, or related fields.
- Participants should bring their own laptops.

The workshop will be conducted in English, with French language support provided by the training team.

### Learning outcomes

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Develop effective research questions tailored to genomic datasets.
- Explain how African genomic diversity enhances variant discovery and biological insights.
- Utilise genomic databases, datasets, and methods to address research questions.
- Design and apply systematic data mining workflows for basic genomic analyses.
